# Sentiment Analysis on Reddit News data

The reddit.com/r/news subreddit has an incredibly active community of users who post relevant (and irrelevant) news articles
almost constantly while also providing comments which indicate on average how the user base feels about a given subject.

I want to find relationships between the text/source of an article and how controversial it is in the reddit comments.
This way we can figure out in real time how people are feeling about different topics.
